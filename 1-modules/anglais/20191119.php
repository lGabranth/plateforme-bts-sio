          My name is Charles, I'm a 23 years old student currently in IT studies, more specifically in developpement. As I'm following a sandwich courses pattern, I'm half of my study time in a company that teaches me more about developpement. 
          Thus, I've developped some skills in web developpement.
          I can't talk about my abilites as it's not me who should be the judge of it.
        </p>

          Concerning my professional experiences, I've been in sandwich courses for few years now. First as an accountant, now as a developper.
